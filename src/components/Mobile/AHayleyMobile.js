            It has taken me 15 years of collegiate study,
            introspection, dozens of continuing education and training,
            healing, and practice to land in my dharma of holding space as a bodyworker.
            The more I practice and trust Vitality the more
            I know it is where I am meant to be to help raise humanity's vibration.

            If there’s one thing I’ve learned since the pandemic began is that we
            heal in connection. In the compassionate presence of another person,
            our bodies have potential to reach a new normal.
            A normal that feels like our wildest dreams and fullest potential.
